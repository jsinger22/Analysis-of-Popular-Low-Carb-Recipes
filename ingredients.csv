2774,Flavored Olive Oil with Fresh Lemon and Herbs — Recipe — Diet Doctor, then you know it is your taste buds.  I personally LOVE the taste of extra virgin olive oil.  Even as a very young child

<p>The odds of that are disturbingly non-trivial. This from late last year:<br />
<a href=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/italy/11988947/Italian-companies-investigated-for-passing-off-ordinary-olive-oil-as-extra-virgin.html rel=nofollow>http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/italy/11988947/Itali...</a><br />
…and similar headlines going back a decade or more.</p>
<p>Adulteration is pervasive"
2777,Flavored Olive Oil with Fresh Lemon and Herbs — Recipe — Diet Doctor, globally
2778,Flavored Olive Oil with Fresh Lemon and Herbs — Recipe — Diet Doctor, and even a prominent Italian branding is little assurance that the substance in the bottle is actually OO
2779,Flavored Olive Oil with Fresh Lemon and Herbs — Recipe — Diet Doctor, much less EVOO. It may well be a random outdated industrial seed/grain oil with colorants and flavoring. The hazards here aren't limited to your palette. Fake OO is almost certainly going to be very high in inflammatory Omega 6 linoleic acid
2780,Flavored Olive Oil with Fresh Lemon and Herbs — Recipe — Diet Doctor," which is in my view the main reason to switch to OO from conventional vegetable oils.</p></div>
